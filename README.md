## Features

- **Parse FASTA files**: Read and parse FASTA files into headers and sequences.
- **Detect sequence type**: Identify whether a sequence is DNA, RNA, or protein.
- **Calculate GC and AT content**: Compute the percentage of GC or AT bases in a sequence.
- **Reverse complement**: Generate the reverse complement of a DNA or RNA sequence.
- **Translate RNA to protein**: Convert an RNA sequence to a protein sequence using a codon table.
- **Filter sequences by length**: Extract sequences within a specified length range.
- **Find longest/shortest sequences**: Identify the longest or shortest sequence in the file.
- **Write to FASTA**: Save sequences to a new FASTA file.

## Installation

To use the `FastaFile` class, clone the repository and install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastafile-class.git
cd fastafile-class
pip install .
```

---

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the `FastaFile` class:

```python
from fastafile import FastaFile

# Initialize the FastaFile object
fasta = FastaFile('examples/example.fasta')

# Get all entries
entries = fasta.get_entries()
for header, sequence in entries:
    print(f"Header: {header}")
    print(f"Sequence: {sequence}")

# Calculate GC content for the first sequence
gc_content = fasta.calculate_gc_content(entries[0][1])
print(f"GC Content: {gc_content:.2f}%")

# Write sequences to a new FASTA file
fasta.write_to_fasta('output.fasta')
```
