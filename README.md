# FastaFile Python Class

A Python class for handling FASTA files, with support for DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. This class provides methods for parsing, analyzing, and manipulating sequences in FASTA format.

## Features

- **Parse FASTA files**: Read and parse FASTA files into headers and sequences.
- **Detect sequence type**: Identify whether a sequence is DNA, RNA, or protein.
- **Calculate GC and AT content**: Compute the percentage of GC or AT bases in a sequence.
- **Reverse complement**: Generate the reverse complement of a DNA or RNA sequence.
- **Translate RNA to protein**: Convert an RNA sequence to a protein sequence using a codon table.
- **Filter sequences by length**: Extract sequences within a specified length range.
- **Find longest/shortest sequences**: Identify the longest or shortest sequence in the file.
- **Write to FASTA**: Save sequences to a new FASTA file.
